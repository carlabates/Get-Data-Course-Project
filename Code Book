ACTIVITY_LABELS
      Activity engaged in for one observation:
            1 Walking
            2 Walking upstairs
            3 Walking downstairs
            4 Sitting
            5 Standing
            6 Laying

The remaining 66 variables were filtered from an original data set of 561 variables for just those variables relating to either the "mean" or the "std"  (note: the "freq" variables related to some of the means were not included either).

The tidy dataset is the mean of the readings for each variable for each activity for each subject, a total of 66 variables per 6 activities for 30 subjects. 

The variable names were retained from the original dataset becuase of their complexity and specificity.  Each of the 66 variables relates to a different smart phone reading.  For more information see referenced article.
